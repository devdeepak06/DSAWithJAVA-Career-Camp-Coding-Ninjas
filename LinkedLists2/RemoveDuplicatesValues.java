//Given a linked list that contain some random integers from 1 to n with many duplicates. You need to replace each duplicate element that is present in the linked list with the values n+1, n+2, and so on (starting from left to right in given LL).
//For eg. if input linked list is
//1 3 1 4 4 2 1 -1
//updated linked list should be -
//1 3 5 4 6 2 7
//n in the list is 4, so I have to replace each duplicate from left to right with 4, 5 and so on. In that way, element 1 (which is at index 2) will be replaced by 5, element 4 (which is present at index 4) by 6 and element 1 (which is present at index 6) by 7.
//You don't need to print the elements, just update the elements in LL.
//Input format :
//Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)
//Output format :
//Updated LL elements (separated by space)
//Constraints :
//1 <= n <= 10^6
//Sample Input 1 :
//1 3 1 4 4 2 1 -1
//Sample Output 1 :
//1 3 5 4 6 2 7
